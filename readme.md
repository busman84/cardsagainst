# Cards Against Assembly

## Description

In this remake of the popular card game students from general Assembly can make up their own cards for other students to give an answer to!  This hilarious fun-filled game allows a user to create new cards and view other cards made by other students.  Once a card is viewed, each other player writes down an answer to the card shown and the person who chose the card then chooses the best answer as the winner of that round.  The winner of that round either creates a new card or turns over a previously made card and the game continues until one player has scored 7 points.

## Technologies Used 

This project was built using the MEAN stack.  Using mongolab to keep our mongo database, we are able to store our users newly made cards.  Using node and express we are able to successfully run our application built with JavaScript.  Further, using Angular 1.0 and the available ui router as a dependency, we are able to create a single page application that allows for three different templates to be used. Finally, we utilized jQuery and bootstrap as well which helped with some ajax calls as well as the layout of our page.
